### 2.1. System Architecture
The Ephurin Novel Platform is built on a **Microservices** architecture, ensuring stability, ease of maintenance, and independent scalability for each module (Web, Mobile, AI).

#### 2.1.1. General Architecture Diagram
![General Architecture Diagram](./images/memberA/So_do_kien_truc.png)

#### 2.1.2. Description of Core Components
1.  **Frontend Clients**:
    -   **Web Application (Next.js)**: The primary platform for Authors to write and Admins to manage. Uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to optimize SEO for literary works.
    -   **Mobile Application (React Native)**: A dedicated app for Readers, focusing on a smooth reading experience and real-time notifications.
2.  **API Gateway**: Acts as the single entry point for all client requests, handling routing to respective microservices and implementing outer security layers (Rate limiting, SSL).
3.  **Backend Microservices**:
    -   **Auth Service**: Manages authentication (JWT), authorization (RBAC), and user account data.
    -   **Novel & Chapter Service**: Handles business logic for story creation, chapter management, drafts, and publishing schedules.
    -   **Interaction Service**: Manages commenting systems (inline/chapter), likes, follows, and social interactions.
    -   **Reader Service**: Optimizes reading content retrieval, history management, and bookmarks.
    -   **Payment Service**: Processes virtual currency (Coins), chapter unlock transactions, and revenue settlement.
4.  **AI Intelligence Service**: A separate intelligent processing module using a Vector Database to store story knowledge, supporting author assistance and automated content moderation.
5.  **Infrastructure Layers**:
    -   **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for data requiring high consistency.
    -   **MongoDB**: Stores unstructured data such as activity logs and draft chapter versions.
    -   **Redis**: Caching layer to speed up access to frequently used data like rankings and login sessions.

**a. Publish a new novel**
![Process of publish a new novel](./images/memberB/image2.png)
*Figure : Process of author request to publish a new novel*

**Detailed Specification:**
1.  **Initiation**: Author starts by requesting to add a new novel.
2.  **Information Entry**: Author fills in metadata (title, description, genre).
3.  **AI Validation**: 
    *   System checks format: Title must be < 255 chars, description > 500 chars.
    *   AI checks for content violations (sensitive topics, hate speech).
4.  **Chapter Creation**: Author must add and save chapters as drafts.
5.  **Requirement Check**: The AI system ensures the novel has at least 5 chapters before allowing a "Publish Request".
6.  **Human Review**: Once submitted, an Admin reviews the novel content.
7.  **Final Action**: If approved, the novel is published; otherwise, it is sent back for edits.

**b. Publish new chapter**
![Process of publish new chapter](./images/memberB/image3.png)
*Figure : Process of author request to publish a new chapter*

**Detailed Specification:**
1.  **Selection**: Author selects an existing novel to add a new chapter.
2.  **Drafting**: Author enters chapter title and content.
3.  **AI Guardrails**: AI validates content length (> 500 chars) and scans for policy violations.
4.  **Submission**: Author saves the draft and sends a publish request.
5.  **Moderation**: Admin verifies the chapter content. Upon approval, the chapter becomes visible to readers.

#### 3.2.3 AI-assisted Metadata Workflow
This is a unique feature of Ephurin, helping standardize content from the start:

![AI Metadata Workflow](./images/memberA/Screenshot%202026-05-14%20144034.png)

1.  **Request Submission**: When the author finishes a chapter or story description, the text is sent to the AI Service.
2.  **Feature Extraction**: AI uses NLP models (PhoBERT/Transformer) to analyze keywords, context, and writing style.
3.  **Classification & Suggestion**:
    *   AI compares content with the existing Taxonomy (genres/tags) to provide the Top 5 most suitable suggestions.
    *   Detects sensitive topics to warn about mandatory Age Rating tags.
4.  **Feedback & Selection**: The author reviews the suggestions and selects which ones to apply. This improves search accuracy for readers.

#### 3.2.3 Quy trình AI hỗ trợ metadata (Gợi ý Tag/Thể loại)
Đây là quy trình đặc trưng của Ephurin, giúp chuẩn hóa nội dung ngay từ bước đầu:

![AI Metadata Workflow](./images/memberA/Screenshot%202026-05-14%20144034.png)


1.  **Gửi yêu cầu**: Khi tác giả soạn thảo xong nội dung chương hoặc mô tả truyện, hệ thống gửi văn bản về AI Service.
2.  **Trích xuất đặc trưng**: AI sử dụng mô hình NLP (PhoBERT/Transformer) để phân tích từ khóa, ngữ cảnh và văn phong.
3.  **Phân loại & Gợi ý**:
    -   AI so sánh với bộ Taxonomy (thể loại/tag) hiện có để đưa ra Top 5 gợi ý phù hợp nhất.
    -   Phát hiện các chủ đề nhạy cảm để cảnh báo gắn tag độ tuổi (Age Rating).
4.  **Phản hồi & Lựa chọn**: Tác giả xem danh sách gợi ý và chọn áp dụng vào tác phẩm. Kết quả này giúp tăng độ chính xác khi độc giả tìm kiếm.

#### 3.2.4 Quy trình Kiểm duyệt nội dung (Admin Review)
